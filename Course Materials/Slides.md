# Role of Numerical & Computational Methods

- Physics: an endeavour to explain what we observe!

- Observations $$\implies$$ Data: structuring, visualisation, and interpretation   

- Data $$\implies$$ Fixing parameters in our models, often statistically, test principles  

- Models $$\implies$$ Predictions: Semi-analytical, Numerical, and Simulations 
  
- Cycle repeats ad infinitum (?)

# Thinking about equations - I

- Models are described by Equations, which in turn are made up of variables

- Physical variables have dimensions such as d, distance has dimensions of Length

- Dimensionless numbers, eg., $$\pi$$

- Dimensionless quantities that still carry units eg., angle $$\theta$$ 

- But, a computer understands equations and vars as dimensionless 

---

- $$y(t) = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$$ or $$y(t)=3+2t-5t^2$$ 

- Certain functions are transcendental eg.,

$$
\begin{align}
\sin u = u - \frac{u^3}{6} + \frac{u^5}{120} + \frac{u^7}{5040} + \cdots  
\end{align}
$$

- Validity requires arguments to be dimensionless!

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = \exp \lambda t = 1 + \lambda t + \frac{(\lambda t)^2}{2} + \cdots  
\end{align}
$$

- Define $$x:=\lambda t$$ and $$\lambda$$ defines a scale
