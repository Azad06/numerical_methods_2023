# Calculating Hubble Constant

From DM and redshift data, we calculated hubble constant as h= 62.69 with uncertainity of 8.1.

First_part.jl --- This code calculates the value of Hubble constant and its distribution using data of FRB given in publication. In data, data is calculated using gold standard.

main_algorith.jl --- This code calculates the value of correct Hubble constant and its distribution using data of FRB given in publication. In data, data is calculated using gold standard

Monte_carlo_marginilzation.py --- this is python code for calculating likelohood of paramteres to get optimised value and check for their likelihood to agree with mock data generated based on certainm parameters.

plot_500w_100steps_trail.png --- this plot shows the plots for 500 walkers distribution for parameters during simulation of 100 steps. 

plot_500w_20steps.png --- this plot shows the plots for 500 walkers distribution for parameters after 20 steps.
