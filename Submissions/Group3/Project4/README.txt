In this project we study the equations describing the components that lead to the evolution of the universe. Ordinary matter--- baryons, dark matter, Radiation, and Dark Energy. The expansion of the universe due to each component is given by the Friedmann equation. The change in the rate is given by the Raychaudhuri equation. Further there are conservation equations for each component. We introduce dimensionless densities. Rewrite everything in terms of them, and analyse the critical points. There are two--- (i) Matter dominated expansion and (ii) Dark Energy (X-fluid) dominated expansion. We introduce radiation dimensionless density as x and DE density as y. Then we were able to eliminate reduce our system to a closed system of 2 eqns.

We then see how the evolution happens in a vector field plot. Any amount of initial dark matter will inevitably lead to a DE dominated expansion (x=0,y=1). If DE is exactly 0, then the (x=0,y=0) point is the attractor meaning a matter-dominated expansion. Radiation dominated expansion happens at (x=1,y=0). If there's nothing else in the universe apart from radiation, then it'll stay that way.


After that we introduce a self-interaction potential for the DE. We take the V0*cosh(mu*X) type potential. We then introduce a new variable z=(del(V)/del(X))/V. Then I don't understand what did they do with the f function, and derivative of z. But at last we end up with a closed system of 3 equations. We take two initial points and watch their evolution in 3D to an attractor. This is also plotted.
