The programs in this folder are:
(1) initial_data.jl   --->  The wavefunction is defined as a function, which is then converted to an array and plotted.

(2) integrate_it.jl   --->  This contains the same function as in (1) which is integrated using Simpson's 1/3 rule. 

(3) coeff_table.jl    --->  This program generates the table of coefficients for order r, to be used as bands in the second derivative matrix.

(4) diff_matrix.jl    --->  This is same as in (3) but actually generates the matrix for easy visualization.
