In this project, we try to understand a simplistic model of interaction of gravity with matter.
There are several ways to do it. But the simpler is to model gravitational field as a classical harmonic oscillator, and matter by a 2-spin system. The HO interacts with the spins by an object called 'a' = (x+ip)/sqrt(2w), w the freq. of the HO. The spins on the other hand, create an effective hamiltonian, whose expectation value adds with the classical hamiltonian and interacts with the field.

We then plot different quantities like Energy of the spin-spin system, energy of the oscillator, and entanglement entropy. We also plot the phase plot of the HO.
