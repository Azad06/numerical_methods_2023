This repository contains Julia code file for accomplishing several tasks as part of Project_1 :  

A generic function for normalizing wavefuncion that uses Simpson 1/3 method

A function that gives coefficient for (2r+1) expansion of second order derivative 
( a short description of method used for this purpose is also attached )

First and second order derivative operator (2r+1) implemented using sparse matrices

Time evolution of Gaussian wavefunction done and plotted
( For checking unitary evolution, Normalization constant is also plotted )

A function for calculation of roots for Pade approximation 
( a short description of method used for this purpose is also attached )

Time evolution of Gaussian wavefunction using improved Pade approximation:
lets one control step size for space and time and r for second order derivative expansion and M for Pade approximation
